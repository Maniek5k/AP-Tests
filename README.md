## Python - Selenium practice repository

Hello

This is my Python + Selenium practice repository.

I'm testing E-commerce shop: http://automationpractice.com/index.php

# At current state following tests are available:

- Search
- Subscribe to newsletter
- Forgotten password
- Login
- Change password

All can be run locally via. testsuite.py -> it runs all tests in consecutive order, after one is finished then next is ran.
